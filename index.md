# Soroban / Cranmer Abacus Problem Sets

To pass an exam, you're supposed to complete a \"10 additions\" table in
10 minutes at \>70% accuracy, and each group of multiplications (or
divisions) in 5 minutes each at 70% accuracy.

So, given the above, an abacus examination is supposed to take at most
30 minutes to be completed.

This is a collection of problem sets at each grade or kyu level. 1st kyu
is the highly advanced and 8th kyu is beginner level.
