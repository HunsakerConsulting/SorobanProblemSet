<p>To pass an exam, youâ€™re supposed to complete a "10 additions" table in 10 minutes at &gt;70% accuracy, and each group of multiplications (or divisions) in 5 minutes each at 70% accuracy.</p>
<p>So, given the above, an abacus examination is supposed to take at most 30 minutes to be completed.</p>
<p>This is a collection of problem sets at each grade or kyu level. 1st kyu is the highly advanced and
 8th kyu is beginner level.</p>
