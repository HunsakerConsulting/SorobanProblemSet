# Soroban / Cranmer Abacus Problem Sets

To pass an exam, you're supposed to complete a "10 additions" table  in 10 minutes at >70% accuracy, and each group of multiplications (or divisions) in 5 minutes each at 70% accuracy.

So, given the above, an abacus examination is supposed to take at most 30 minutes to be completed.

This is a collection of problem sets at each grade or kyu level. 1st kyu is the most advanced and 13th kyu is absolute beginner level.
